  </h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The first thing I want to write, is how hard it is to write anything about myself! 
      There doesn't really feel like there's anything good to say, but I'm here starting to learn things I've wanted to learn for a long time 
      and that's something I'd love to encourage everyone to do!</p>

    <p>My wonderful sister encouraged me to dabble in html over 20 years ago and that's left me with the feeling I have unfinished business to attend to. 
      Back then I used it as a tool to be silly, and that's still something high on my priority list</p>

    <p>I'm just starting out again, hoping to pick up enough skills to be creative and see where it takes me. Thanks for taking a peek at my first new steps!</p>
