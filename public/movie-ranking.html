        <h2>Three films I can remember finding interesting or fun</h2>

        <hr />

        <h3>Monster (2023) Kore-Eda Hirokazu</h3>
        <p>An emotional glimpse over the shoulder of 2 highschool kids and the people around them as they bump up against the restrictions and judgements of society. <br />
           Nothing is only as it seems.
        </p>

        <h3>Survive Style 5+, Gen Sekiguchi</h3>
        <p>I remember it being wild and beautiful, full of people living lives full of mistakes.
        </p>

        <h3>Worst Person in the World, Joachim Trier</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you need a story to reflect the rhythym of lifes frustrations and feelings of doubt. This film held them up and held them close.
